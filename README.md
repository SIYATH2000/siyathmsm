This is my portfolio webpage developed using HTML, CSS and JS. Here, I have added a back to top button to scroll top easily and we can move smoothly to the particular part through click on the links which are available in navigation bar. In home page there is a text animation built by JS. Contact form also available in the bottom of the page. There is a copyright content also available in bottom of the page. To contact me, I have added social links and connected that to my social media accounts.

For the assignment 4, I have used the method 1 that I have uploaded all the necessary sourcecode files with tha php connection file and the sql dump of my database.

Thank you.
